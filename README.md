# Common-Software-Algos
A few of the greatest hits, written in C++.

Desired algorithms:
- My Iterative Closest Point algorithm in my [Navigation Algorithms Repo](https://github.com/tcmilleriii/Navigation-Algorithms) would benefit from use of a KD-Tree technique to identify closest points!

Desired updates:
- I see some opportunity to transform these "example" algorithms into functional tools within my own projects. Will likely be updating this repo with stripped-down function versions of these so that I can bring them in as tools in my arsenal in my Navigation Repo (or others as I develop interests beyond just that repo).
